## Backstory

The Deeproot Project started off as an 8th grade science project, where it rapidly turned into a full fledged application. Deeproot's goal is to provide efficient plant disease detection to variety of different audiences, depending on their needs and use cases. It is powered by a deep learning ensemble to accurately detect over 23+ crops diseases across 89 different classes. It is developed with Swift, Python, and was largely developed with Tensorflow and YoloV8. 

The Deeproot Project recently placed first at the Florida Junior Academy of Science in Melbourne, Florida.

## Deeproot Pipelines

There are 3 main pipelines for Deeproot:

1. iOS (Consumer targeted) we're in alpha and release invites in our Discord or Github. It can be downloaded to an iOS device via git cloning this repository through Xcode, however it is expected to be on the app store soon.
2. Hailo A.I Neural Processors (Embedded systems/Large scale targeted). This version is without a U.I, however it is the fastest and least power consuming version. It requires a Hailo 8 or Hailo 8L A.I chip to use.
3. Native. (Developer targeted) The barebones and flexible version of deeproot. It has an optional customtkinter user interface, however it is recommended for only testing purposes.
